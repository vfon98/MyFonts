
Xirwena (ASCII)
__________________________________________

... was created by Pia Frauss in 2003, with High-Logic's FontCreator program, and updated in 2005, 2007, and 2010. You have downloaded the 2010 (2.00) version.

You are welcome to enjoy this font.

Xirwena is free for private use. For commercial use, please visit my "Conditions of Use" page at

The Xirwena font's lower case characters are based on a sample from a manuscript copy of Dante's Divina Commedia, written in 1337, and commonly referred to as the Codex Trivulziano. The upper case glyphs, on the other hand, have been inspired by German Bastarda writings from various sources; they are no exact matches, though.

Xirwena is a fancy name, and the heraldic lily contained in the font has been inspired by the arms of the city of Florence.

There is no number sign in this font. In its place, you'll find a *long s*.
Moreover, you'll find a less space-consuming *d* on the bar sign...
... as well as an *ld* ligature and a double *l* on the left and right curly brackets.
The *long s* will show up as a double long s.

UPDATE 2007 has moved the curly brackets to the fi and fl signs (or the masculine/feminine ordinal indicators, or the 'less/greater than or equal to' signs), has reduced the file size by redesigning the composite glyphs, and has corrected some minor flaws.

UPDATE 2010 has redesigned all of the composite glyphs (correcting the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*), and enlarged the dashes.
