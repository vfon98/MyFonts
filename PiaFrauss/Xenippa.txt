
Xenippa (ASCII)
________________________________________

... was created by Pia Frauss in 2003, with High-Logic's FontCreator program, and updated in 2005, 2007, and 2010. You have downloaded version 1.30 (completed in 2010). I hope you'll enjoy this font.

Based on French Bastarda writing and some -- freely handled -- Rotunda capitals, this font has no match in historic documents.

The name 'Xenippa' is Greek and means 'having strange (= not one's own) horses'.

UPDATE 2007 has reduced the file size, by redesigning the composite glyps, has added an *s* that sits on the line, as well as a Yen sign, has corrected the *L/ldot*, and has moved some of the special characters. These are now:

- an *et* ligature on the left curly bracket 
- an *st* ligature on the right curly bracket 
- the new alternate *s* on the bar and broken bar sign 
- a double *long s* on the long s sign 
- a *long s*+*t* ligature on the 'not equal' sign

The alternate *C* and *E* have gone off to the masculine ordinal indicator (*fi*, 'less than or equal to' sign) and feminine ordinal indicator (*fl*, 'greater than or equal to' sign); and the alternate *G* can be found on the 'divide' sign.

The *long s*, however, still keeps its place on the number sign.

UPDATE 2010 has enlarged the dashes, has the composite glyphs redesigned (especially the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*), and has created a new *m*.
