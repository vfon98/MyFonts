
DeiGratia (ASCII)
__________________________________________

... was created by Pia Frauss in 2005, with High-Logic's FontCreator program. It has been updated in 2007 and 2010. You hace downloaded the 1.20 version (2010).

 I hope you'll enjoy this font.

The DeiGratia font is rather closely based on a charter issued in 1275 by the German emperor Rudolf of Hapsburg, and will appear to best advantage in longer texts.

There is no number sign in this font. In its place, you'll find a *long s*. Equally, you'll find extras in other places:

- a double *f* on the left bracket
- a double *p* on the right bracket
- a double *l* on the left curly bracket
- a double *g* on the right curly bracket
- a double *long s* on the long s sign
- the charter's most eye-catching abbreviation sign on the asciitilde (it should be used like an accent)
- a separator of sentences on the bar sign 
- as well as a *long s*+*t* ligature and the original *N* on the *fi* and *fl*; -- or, if they aren't reachable on your computer, on the masculine and feminine ordinal indicators, or the 'less-than or equal to'  and the 'greater than or equal to' signs .

Update 2007 has corrected some minor flaws (like replacing the dots in the*L/ldot* signs).

Update 2010 has redesigned all of the composite glyphs (correcting the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*), and enlarged the dashes.
