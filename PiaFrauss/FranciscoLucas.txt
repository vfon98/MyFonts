
FranciscoLucas Briosa & FrancisoLucas Llana (ASCII)
_____________________________________________

... were created by Pia Frauss in 2003, with High-Logic's FontCreator program. They were updated in 2005, 2007, and in 2010.  You have downloaded (the 2010) version 2.00 of both fonts.

I hope you'll enjoy these fonts.

FranciscoLucas Llana is based on a sample text written at Madrid in 1570, by a man called Francisco Lucas. FranciscoLucas Briosa is an alternate and more swashed version of FranciscoLucas Llana, designed after an alphabet of capitals created by the same writing master, and in the same year 1570.

UPDATE 2010 has not only enlarged the dashes and redesigned all of the composite glyphs, in both fonts (and corrected the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*, of course), it has also given FranciscoLucas Llana a new *E*, *W*, *g*, and *y*. As a consequence, the alternate glyphs, which were formerly the same in both fonts, are now different.

In FranciscoLucas Llana, you'll find the the following alternate glyphs: 

- the former *g* instead of the left bracket 
- a plain *z* instead of the right bracket 
- the former *E* instead of the left curly bracket 
- a slender *K* instead of the right curly bracket 
- a slender *Z* on the bar and broken bar sign. 

In FranciscoLucas Briosa, you'll find the the following alternate glyphs: 

- a rather condensed *g* instead of the left bracket 
- an alternate *y* instead of the right bracket 
- an alternate *E* instead of the left curly bracket 
- a very swashed *R* instead of the right curly bracket 
- a final *e* instead of the bar and broken bar sign

Both fonts have a double *long s* on the long s sign, as well as a *st* and a *ct* ligature on the fi and fl keys (in case the fi and fl signs aren't reachable on your computer, you might try the masculine and feminine ordinal indicators, or the 'less-than or equal to', and the 'greater than or equal to' signs).

There is no number sign in these fonts. In its place, you'll find a long s. 

UPDATE 2007 had reduced the files' size, by redesigning the composite glyphs, and corrected some flaws -- above all, an error concerning the lcedilla sign.
