
_a e i o u  (ASCII)
__________________________________________

... was created by Pia Frauss in 2007, with High-Logic's FontCreator program, and updated in 2010. You have downloaded version 1.10 (completed in 2010).

I hope you'll enjoy this font.

The _a e i o u font is based on a charter issued in 1460 by the German emperor Friedrich/Frederick III.
It has been called '_a e i o u', because Frederick used to have marked all objects of value he possessed -- or got made -- with the five vowels (and the font's underscore contains Frederick's typical underline stroke: the mark wouldn't be genuine without that).

_a e i o u  is free for private use. For commercial use, please visit my "Conditions of Use" page at

As usual, the number sign in this font has been replaced with a long s. The other special characters are: 

-an alternate *k* on the 'less than' sign, and 
-an alternate *K* on the 'greater than' sign

Those have been made necessary by the regular *K* and *k* taking too much room -- looking rather messy in such important sentences like 'Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz'.
 
-an alternate *r* on the left bracket 
-an alternate *d* on the right bracket 
-a swashed *m* on the left curly bracket 
-a swashed *n* on the right curly bracket 
-a swash from the document on the ASCII tilde 
-a swashed *h* on the bar and broken bar sign 
-an alternate *f* on the masculine ordinal indicator 
-a *long s*+*t* ligature on the long s sign.

The coat of arms contained in this font is based on the painting in the document. 

UPDATE 2010 has redesigned all of the composite glyphs (correcting the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*), and enlarged the dashes.
