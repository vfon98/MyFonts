This font is based on an Tycho Brahes handwriting, i.e., an autograph version of his poem AD DANIAM ELEGIA, on show among the digital exhibits of the Royal Library of Denmark:

There is no number sign in this font. In its place, you'll find a *long s*. Other extras in this font are: 

- an alternate *g* on the 'less than' sign 
- an alternate *y* on the 'greater than' sign (that should be used with the regular *g*) 
- a swashed *t* on the right bracket 
- an alternate *d*, turned left, on the left bracket 
- an ending *e* on the right curly bracket 
- an ending *n* on the left curly bracket (can also be used as an *u*) 
- a swashed *k* on the bar and broken bar sign 
- a swash on the ASCII tilde. It has to be typed like an accent, before the letter to which it belongs, and looks nice with *b*, *f*, *h*, both *k*s, and *l*, especially before the second of a double *l*. Of course, Tycho would not use that. I made it up, according to the swashed *t*, which was really penned by Tycho. 
- a double *long s* on the long s sign. 
- The ASCII tilde has been relocated to the 'almost equal to' sign.

The image on the micro sign is my rendition of the Brahe coat of arms.
