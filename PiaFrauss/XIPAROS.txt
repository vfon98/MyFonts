The XIPAROS font is sort of an extract of some German charters issued nine hundred years ago by the German emperor Henry V. Its lower case letters are rather genuine, if perhaps a bit more regular, and less edgy than the originals. However, I reduced the disproportions between upper and middle zone, and shortened the *r* to sit on the line. As for the upper case characters, I made them up myself out of the *long s*, trying to give a legible impression of those charters' more bizarre compositions. 

There are some of the contemporary decorations included in the XIPAROS font. However, they aren't attached to the glyphs. With one exception, they have to be typed like accents before the glyphs to which they belong, and you'll have to go for them on the following keys:

-- On the less sign, you'll find a zigzag line that works with *b*, *k*, and *l*. 
-- On the greater sign, you'll find a zigzag line that works with *f* and *h*. 
-- The + sign contains a little end swash that will look well after *c*, *e*, *g*, *o*, *r*, *s*, *t*, *v*, *w*, *x*, *y*, and *z*. This is the one and only of the font's decorations to be typed after the letter to which it belongs. 
-- On the = sign, there is a little swash that will look well before words beginning with *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*, *d*, *o*, *p*, *s*, and *t*. Its original use was that of an abbreviation sign, applied before the *p*, and meaning the syllable pro; but I've seen it before other letters as well, even in the middle of a word, and don't have the least idea as to its meaning in those contexts. 
-- On the left bracket, you'll find a hook that will add a loop to the letter *j*. 
-- On the right bracket, you'll find a hook that will add a loop to the letter *g*. 
-- The bar and broken bar sign contain an abbreviation sign of absolutely indefinite meaning, which will look well above every lower case letter except the *i* and *j*. 
-- On the left curly bracket, you'll find a double loop to be combined with *d*, *H*, *S*, and *ll*. 
-- On the right curly bracket, you'll find the double loop that should work well with *f*, *h*, *l*, *k*, and ... 

... the *long s* -- which, of course, is occupying its usual place, on the number sign.

UPDATE 2010 has redesigned all of the composite glyphs (correcting the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*), and enlarged the dashes.
