
MitreSquare (ASCII)

... is a font created by Pia Frauss in 2010, with High-Logic's FontCreator. You have downloaded version 1.00.

This font is based on the facsimile of the copy of a police report -- both, report and copy, were written in October of 1888 --, dealing with the murder of Catherine Eddowes, on September 30, 1888, at London Mitre Square. I found the facsimile in the folder "Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders. The true story through contemporary documents", edited by Stewart P Evans and Keith Skinner (Public Record Office/The National Archives).

The pattern of the MitreSquare font having been written in 1888, with a steel pen, this is now a *genuine VICTORIAN* font. Please be so kind as to consider using the MitreSquare font, and not the JaneAusten one (Jane Austen was REGENCY, and writing with a quill pen), whenever you want to create a Victorian look, by using one of my fonts.

On the number sign of the MitreSquare font, you'll find the copist's number sign (N°), for a change.
The other alternate characters are

- a *th* on the 'bar' and 'broken bar' sign. This special *t* only occurs in combination with an *h*. 
- an alternate *g* on the 'less' sign (the regular *g* and *y* don't connect well) 
- an alternate *y* on the 'more' sign (ditto) 
- an alternate *e* -- the conventional one -- on the left bracket 
- an alternate *d* on the right bracket 
- an alternate *t* on the left curly bracket 
- another alternate *t* on the right curly bracket 
- an alternate *s* on the ASCII tilde (the one with the extra stroke that joins the following character) 
- the ASCII circumflex has changed into an ASCII tilde.

The image on the micro sign is based on a 19th century engraving of Christ Church, Spitalfields.
