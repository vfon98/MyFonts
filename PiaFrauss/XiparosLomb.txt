
XiparosLombard (ASCII)
_________________________________________

... was created by Pia Frauss in 2005, with High-Logic's FontCreator program, and updated in 2010. You have downloaded the 2010 1.20 version.

I hope you'll enjoy this font.

As to its lower case characters, the XiparosLombard font is identical with the XIPAROS font -- apart from the *d*, which has been replaced by a straight version. The upper case alphabet, however, consists of Lombardic capitals. 

The XiparosLombard font contains no decorations, and you'll find all the brackets, curly brackets, and greater/less signs here that are lacking in the XIPAROS font, as well as the +, =, and bar sign. Do I have to mention that the number sign has taken the shape of a long s?

UPDATE 2010 has redesigned all of the composite glyphs (correcting the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*), and enlarged the dashes.
