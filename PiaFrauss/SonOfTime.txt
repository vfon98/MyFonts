This font is based on the handwriting of Giovanni Borgia / Joan Borja, duke of Gandia, who was a son of the Borgia pope Alexander VI. The pattern for this font is an image of an autograph letter, displayed on the website of the 'Institut Internacional d'Estudis Borgians' (http://www.elsborja.org/). However, it differs from the pattern in many respects, since nearly all the capitals (as well as the figures) had to be invented, and some of the lower case characters were deliberately kept on the 'modern' side.

On the number sign of the SonOfTime font, you'll find the usual *long s*. The other special characters are 

- an alternate *y* on the 'bar' and 'broken bar' sign. 
- an alternate *d on the left bracket 
- an alternate *z*, sitting on the line, on the right bracket 
- an alternate *k* on the left curly bracket, This is an important alternative, since the regular *k* is at war with the regular *y*, even when there is a space or another character between them 
- an alternate *r* on the right curly bracket. It's the one that is most frequently used in the letter, but somehow it didn't cooperate well with the other characters of the font. 
- an alternate capital *I* on the ASCII circumflex (don't forget to press the space bar) 
- a double *long s* on the long s sign 
- Two frequently used abbreviation signs, meaning 'que' and 'per', on the fi and fl signs. In case those aren't reachable on your computer, please try the masculine and feminine ordinal indicators, or the 'less-than or equal to' and the 'greater than or equal to' signs.

I've included my own rendition of the Borgia arms on the micro sign.
