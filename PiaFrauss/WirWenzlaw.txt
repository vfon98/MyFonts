This is a genuine Bastarda, written at Prague in the year 1400, at the chancery of one Wenzlaw, who was king of Bohemia and Roman king. The font is called after the first two words of that document, saying -- in German -- "We Wenzlaw..."

There is no number sign in this font. In its place, you'll find a *long s*. Equally, you'll find an alternate *d* on the bar sign; and the right and left bracket keys contain a double *p* and an alternate *v*. Update 2007 has provided a 'normal' *n* on the underscore, and the *long s* sign in this font will show up as a double *long s*.

UPDATE 2007 has, moreover, reduced the file size, by redesigning the composite glyphs, has tried to embellish the figures and the *m*, has corrected the *L/ldot*, and has moved the brackets: the left one to the fi sign, the masculine ordinal indicator, and the 'less-than or equal to' sign, the right one to the fl sign, the feminine ordinal indicator, and the 'greater-than or equal to' sign.

UPDATE 2010 has redesigned all of the composite glyphs (correcting the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*), and enlarged the dashes.
