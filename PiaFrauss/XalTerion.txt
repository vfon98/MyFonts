
XalTerion (ASCII)
__________________________________________________

... is a font created by Pia Frauss in 2007, with High-Logic's FontCreator program, and updated in 2010. You have downloaded the 2010 version (2.00).

You are welcome to enjoy this font.

XalTerion is free for private use. For commercial use, please visit my "Conditions of Use" page at

This font was inspired by an image I found on the Web. The *b*, *h*, *p*, and *t* are based on a calligraphy by an eminent North American artist, and the rest of the font was designed to match those characters.

The font name is fancy (pronouncing the X as an s may give it some meaning), and the winged beast on the micro sign is based on a detail from a very elaborate mediaeval inital.

For a change, the XalTerion font has a number sign -- and on the correct key, too! There is a *long s*, but it hasn't been allowed to leave its place. And the only alternate character in this font is a cursive *g* on the bar and broken bar sign. 

UPDATE 2010 has considerably downsized the font, has made the stems of the *b*, *d*, *f*, *h*, *k*, and *l* somewhat higher (the 'Th' will look a lot better now), and enlarged the dashes. It has also had all the composite glyphs redesigned. However, in the interest of keeping the file size down, the ASCII version does not contain the additional accented characters that have been made for the UNICODE font. If you need any of them, please download the font at its proper page (http://www.pia-frauss.de/fonts/xt.htm).
