
MalaTesta (= MalaTestaN & MalaTestaCK) 
__________________________________________________

... are ASCII fonts created by Pia Frauss in 2010, with High-Logic's FontCreator. You have downloaded version 1.00 of both fonts.
This is essentially one font that comes in two weights. I called them MalaTestaCK and MalaTestaN, because ck and n are the consonants that distinguish the words 'thick' and 'thin'.

You are welcome to enjoy these fonts.

The MalaTesta fonts are free for private use. For commercial use, please visit my "Conditions of Use" page at

The MalaTesta fonts are based on a writing sample, titled "Lettere piacevolle", and dating from the 16th century. Apparently, it was first published in 1571, as part of "A booke containing divers sortes of hands", by J. de Beauchesne and J. Baildon. Beauchesne/Baildon seem to not have revealed the name of the writing master who created the sample.

As to the name MalaTesta, I think it's self-explaining -- for these fonts can get quite messy. All of those curls, and hooks, and swashes, which may produce rather pretty effects in the right places, will get horribly entangled in the wrong ones. Therefore, the use of alternate characters, in these fonts, should not be avoided. They have been designed, not to make the font look more elaborate, but to simplify things. You might at least consider to use the bar or broken bar sign, whenever you want to type a *Th* in one of these fonts.

On the number sign of the MalaTesta fonts, you'll find a *long s*, as usual. The other irregular characters are
 
- an alternate *g* on the 'plus' sign 
- a double *g* on the 'equal' sign 
- an alternate *y* on the 'less' sign 
- an alternate *p* on the 'more' sign 
- a *Th* on the 'bar' and 'broken bar' sign, which you are strongly recommended to use, since no amount of kerning can make the regular *T* and *h* work well together 
- a simple *l*, without the top curl, on the left bracket, which you are strongly recommended to use, too, whenever an l is followed by another *l*, or a *b*, *f*, *h*, or *k* ... it will look a lot less messy! 
- an alternate *d* on the right bracket 
- a double *f* on the left curly bracket 
- a double *p* on the right curly bracket 
- a curly ending *e* on the 'degree' sign 
- a little swash on the ASCII circumflex sign, that is best used to make a *t* preceded by an *s*, *c*, e* etc look like a ligature. It has to be typed like an accent, before the *t*. 
- a bigger swash on the ASCII tilde sign, to be used wherever it fits 
- a double *long s* on the long s sign 
- and, just in case, if you really need a 'plus' sign with this font, you'll find it on the 'plus/minus' sign. 

The images on the micro sign are wholly unconnected to the fonts, and were designed after some rather funny initials from a medieval codex. They are meant to be an M and a T.
