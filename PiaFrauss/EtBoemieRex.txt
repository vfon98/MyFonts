
EtBoemieRex (ASCII)
________________________________________________

... is a font created by Pia Frauss in 2007, with High-Logic's FontCreator program, and updated in 2010. You have downloaded the 1.10 version.

I hope you'll enjoy this font.

The EtBoemieRex font is based on a charter issued in 1359 by the German/Roman emperor Charles IV, granting a market privilege to the city of Hambourg.

On the number sign of the EtBoemieRex font, you'll find a *long s*. The other special characters are 

- an alternate *f* on the 'plus' sign, since the normal one will collide with the i and a lot of accented characters 
- an alternate *d* on the 'bar' and 'broken bar' sign, less encumbrant than the normal one
- a double *l* on the left bracket
- an *fl* ligature on the right bracket 
- a swashed *m* on the left curly bracket, to be used at the ending of a word 
- a swashed *n* on the right curly bracket, to be used at the ending of a word 
- a *long s*+*t* ligature on the long s sign  
- an *ft* ligature, and a swashed *t*, on the fi and fl keys. If these characters aren't reachable on your computer, you might try the masculine and feminine ordinal indicators, or the 'less-than or equal to' and the 'greater than or equal to' signs. 
- and, just in case, if you really need a 'plus' sign with this font, you'll find it on the 'plus/minus' sign.

UPDATE 2010 has redesigned all of the composite glyphs (correcting the *dcaron*, *L/lcaron*, and *tcaron*), and enlarged the dashes.
